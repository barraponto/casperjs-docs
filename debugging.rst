Debugging
=========

First, in all honesty, sometimes debugging CasperJS scripts can be
**painful**, and so for several reasons:

-  There's `no built-in solid stack traces in Exception objects in
   PhantomJS <http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=166>`_,
   and that's probably why I, more than often, can't show you something
   more helpful than a laconic *TypeError: 'undefined' is not a
   function*\ … The only stuff we have is a limited emulation of stack
   traces provided by PhantomJS using its ``onError`` built-in listener,
   hence those you possibly see when using CasperJS…
-  There's `no built-in module support in
   PhantomJS <http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/issues/detail?id=47>`_.
   The current implementation you're using in CasperJS is somehow a
   dirty hack, which combined to the lack of proper support for stack
   traces and standard error localization obfuscates a lot script
   debugging…
-  Last, Javascript being a wonderful language, it's still very dynamic
   and weakly typed… Well, do I really need to say more? ;)

Despite all these issues, you can eventually manage to get around
debugging using some (all?) of the tricks listed above.

Use the verbose mode
--------------------

By default & by design, a ``Casper`` instance won't print anything to
the console. This can be very limitating & frustrating when creating or
debugging scripts, so a good practice is to always start coding a script
using these settings:

::

    var casper = require('casper').create({
        verbose: true,
        logLevel: "debug"
    });

The ``verbose`` setting will tell Casper to write every logged message
at the ``logLevel`` logging level onto the standard output, so you'll be
able to trace every step made.

Warning Output will then be pretty verbose, and will potentially display
sensitive informations onto the console. **Use with care on
production.**

Hook in the deep using events
-----------------------------

`Events <events-filters.html>`_ are a very powerful features of
CasperJS, and you should probably give it a look if you haven't already.

Some interesting events you may eventually use to debug your scripts:

-  The ``http.status.XXX`` event will be emitted everytime a resource is
   sent with the `HTTP
   code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes>`_
   corresponding to ``XXX``;
-  The ``remote.alert`` everytime an ``alert()`` call is performed
   client-side;
-  ``remote.message`` everytime a message is sent to the client-side
   console;
-  ``step.added`` everytime a step is added to the stack;
-  etc…

Listening to an event is dead easy:

::

    casper.on('http.status.404', function(resource) {
        this.log('Hey, this one is 404: ' + resource.url, 'warning');
    });

Ensure to check the `full list <events-filters.html#events>`_ of all the
other available events.

Localize yourself in modules
----------------------------

If you're creating Casper modules, a cool thing to know is that there's
a special built-in variable available in every module, ``__file__``,
which contains the absolute path to current javascript file (the module
file).

Always, **ALWAYS** name your closures
-------------------------------------

Probably one of the most easy but effective best practice, always name
your closures:

**Hard to track:**

::

    casper.start('http://foo.bar/', function() {
        this.evaluate(function() {
            // ...
        });
    });

**Easier:**

::

    casper.start('http://foo.bar/', function afterStart() {
        this.evaluate(function evaluateStuffAfterStart() {
            // ...
        });
    });

That way, everytime one is failing, its name will be printed out in the
*stack trace*, **so you can more easily locate it within your code**.

Note that this one also applies for all your other Javascript works, of
course ;)
